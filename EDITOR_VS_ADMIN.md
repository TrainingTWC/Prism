### For Existing Users

**If you were previously using "Admin" password:**
- Old: `Editornotcreator2025!` gave admin access
- **New**: Use `Editornotcreator2025!` for **Editor** role (same password, different role name)
- Or use `AdminView2024!` for view-only admin access

   - Share only with authorized configuration managers
